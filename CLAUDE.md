# Tessera

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# HOW THIS FILE WORKS
#
# This file is the INTERACTIVE-SESSION loader. Interactive Claude Code sessions
# auto-load CLAUDE.md from the working directory; the headless pipeline does NOT
# load this file — it assembles its own system prompt from the split files
# below.
#
# Keep this file thin. Project-wide context belongs here. Discipline content
# belongs in the per-role files so the pipeline can load only what each role
# needs.
#
# File layout:
#   CLAUDE-COMMON.md       Universal disciplines + Superpowers + tier rubric.
#                          Loaded for every role.
#   CLAUDE-ARCHITECT.md    Architect role block + Architect reinforcements.
#   CLAUDE-IMPLEMENTER.md  Implementer role block + Implementer reinforcements.
#   CLAUDE-REVIEWER.md     Reviewer role block + Reviewer reinforcements.
#   CLAUDE-MEMORIAL.md     Memorial Updater role block + Memorial reinforcements.
#   coordination/.role-stamp  (gitignored) per-invocation role identity.
#
# The pipeline (run-pipeline.sh) concatenates CLAUDE-COMMON.md + the matching
# CLAUDE-<ROLE>.md + .role-stamp as the system prompt for each role session.
# That keeps the cacheable prefix byte-identical across worktrees while halving
# per-session prompt weight versus loading a monolithic CLAUDE.md.
#
# Memorial Updater appends REINFORCED lines to the role file matching the
# violating role (or CLAUDE-COMMON.md for cross-role lessons). Do not delete
# prior reinforcements — accumulated history is the compounding value.
#
# To start a new project: cp CLAUDE.md.template CLAUDE.md, fill in project
# name; copy the CLAUDE-*.md templates similarly. Add coordination/.role-stamp
# to .gitignore.

# ── INTERACTIVE-SESSION DEFAULT ───────────────────────────────────────────────
# When you're working in an interactive Claude Code session and want the full
# role discipline loaded:
#   1. Identify the role you're acting as (or "all").
#   2. Read CLAUDE-COMMON.md plus the relevant CLAUDE-<ROLE>.md file(s).
# When you're working at the operator level (deciding which round to run,
# resolving an escalation, reviewing outputs), the universal disciplines in
# CLAUDE-COMMON.md are usually sufficient.

# ── PROJECT CONTEXT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Tessera is the per-shard observation layer derived from DeploySignal's
# statistical-detector engine. Phase 1 vendors the load-bearing engine subset
# and extends the compile-time schema with shard-level primitives; later phases
# add per-shard residual semantics, hierarchical e-value combination, and the
# e-BH FDR operator surface.
#
# Coordination artifacts live in coordination/. Vendoring policy + manifest:
# coordination/SCOPING-MEMO-v0.3.md § 9 + coordination/VENDORING-MANIFEST.md.
