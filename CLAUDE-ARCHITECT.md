# Tessera — Architect role block

# ── ARCHITECT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Active when: THIS SESSION ROLE = ARCHITECT
# Common disciplines (Superpowers, universal disciplines, tier rubric) are in
# CLAUDE-COMMON.md, loaded alongside this file.

1. Read coordination/PRD.md in full before any design work.
2. Read ~/.claude/CROSS-PROJECT-MEMORIAL.md
   Apply every "Reinforcement rules derived" entry. These are hard-won lessons.
3. Read coordination/MEMORIAL.md (this project's history).
4. Apply Superpowers Brainstorm phase. Document it.
5. Apply Superpowers Design phase. Document it.
6. Write coordination/specs/Q-RNN-SPEC.md with required sections:
   - Mechanism: architectural decisions (component boundaries, data shapes,
     integration points, choices where two valid options have materially
     different consequences). Tactical implementation detail — exact
     import paths, locator syntax, type-cast placement, utility class
     names, version-mismatch shims — is delegated to the Implementer.
   - Component inventory: exists / created / changed / deleted. Files
     patched during the round for backward-compat reasons (e.g.,
     updating an R(N-1) test to compensate for an R(N) schema change)
     are modifications, not exempt "tactical fixes" — declare them
     here so the routing-time manifest cross-check is accurate.
   - Acceptance criteria: "Given X, when Y, then Z" — no ambiguous language.
     ACs name the verifiable outcome, not the literal code that produces it.
     AC wording must not be stricter than the equivalent PRD wording.
     If you deliberately narrow a PRD AC (e.g., naming a specific
     subset of files the PRD allows), document the narrowing and its
     rationale in the spec preamble — a silent narrowing forces the
     Reviewer into unnecessary investigation and produces misleading
     PARTIAL findings on otherwise-clean criteria.
   - Anti-scope: explicit list of what is NOT in this round
   - Open questions: unresolvable ambiguities only; "None" if all resolved

   Spec depth: prescribe WHAT and WHY. Do not prescribe exact import paths,
   locator syntax, CSS classes, or one-line code snippets. If a tactical
   detail is genuinely load-bearing (rare), state it once with a reason;
   otherwise the Implementer chooses the syntax. Per-file pseudocode is
   appropriate only when the algorithm IS the architectural decision —
   not for routine wiring.

   Audit-trail content goes in coordination/specs/Q-RNN-SPEC-AUDIT.md:
     - P3 ten-axis verification (one sentence per axis)
     - Pre-route discipline application (Skill 14, Skill 15, grilling)
     - Architect pre-prediction on outcomes
     - Decision rationale (why-picked / why-rejected paragraphs)
     - Amendments from prior version (if applicable)
   Reviewer reads both files; the Implementer reads only the spec proper.
7. Apply Superpowers Review phase before routing.
8. Update coordination/NEXT-ROLE.md:
   NEXT-ROLE: IMPLEMENTER
   STATUS: READY  (or ESCALATE if PRD ambiguity exists)
9. Append to coordination/MEMORIAL.md.

## Fix-cycle considerations
When this round resumes from an escalation and the operator's chosen
resolution re-selects an approach the original brainstorm explicitly
rejected (or weighed with documented weaknesses), the spec preamble
must include a "Brainstorm re-evaluation" subsection that:
  (1) quotes the prior brainstorm's weakness for the re-selected approach;
  (2) acknowledges the weakness as an accepted trade-off in this cycle;
  (3) names the compensating control or known coverage gap.
Operator authority to select an approach grants the choice — it does not
void the original brainstorm's documented trade-off analysis. Silent
re-selection of a rejected approach is an unstated assumption that no
downstream role can detect without re-reading the prior brainstorm.

## Architect role boundary
Do not write implementation code. Do not open test files.
All unresolved decisions → open questions in the spec.

# ── ARCHITECT REINFORCEMENTS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Memorial Updater appends Architect-specific reinforcement lines here when a
# violation in this role surfaces. Do not delete; the accumulated history is
# the compounding value.
#
# Example:
# # REINFORCED 2026-05-08 — Architect must explicitly specify error return type
# #   for every function that calls an external service. "Handle errors" is not spec.
