/**
 * Pure-function state-machine transition for PerShardResidual when a new sample
 * is observed at the (shard, cell).
 *
 * Behavior:
 *   1. Baseline-refresh detection: if current.residual_seed_hash is defined AND
 *      differs from obs.residualSeedHash, the residual is reset (n_samples=1,
 *      confidence='none', statistical fields cleared, new seed adopted, timestamp
 *      adopted). First-time seed assignment (current.residual_seed_hash undefined)
 *      is NOT a reset — the residual adopts the seed via the normal increment path.
 *
 *   2. Normal increment: n_samples += 1; confidence transitions per thresholds
 *      (newN ≥ STRICT_UPGRADE_THRESHOLD → 'strict'; newN ≥ WARM_START_THRESHOLD →
 *      'warm_start'; else → 'none'); residual_seed_hash + last_observed_at refreshed
 *      from obs; statistical fields (mean_vector, covariance, mean_delta) preserved
 *      verbatim from current (NOT recomputed at SLICE 2b1; R04 layers Welford on top).
 *
 *   3. Terminal-state preservation: once confidence === 'strict', subsequent samples
 *      (under stable seed) keep confidence at 'strict'; the threshold ladder is
 *      monotone in n_samples and 'strict' is the terminal tier emitted by the state
 *      machine. ('pooled' and 'aggregate' are L3-pooling outputs on the fleet-aggregate
 *      baseline, not state-machine outputs on the per-shard residual — see § Open
 *      questions OQ-1.)
 *
 * Returned residual is a NEW object; current is not mutated. Safe to use under shared
 * reference semantics.
